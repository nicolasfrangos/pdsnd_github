### Date created
This project was created in March of 2021 while completing the Udacity NanoDegree Program: Programming for Data Science with Python.

### Project Title
Bikeshare Project through Udacity's NanoDegree Program

### Description
This project was about using Python to write a program that would pull information/data regarding usage of bikesharing programs in the cities of New York, Chicago, and Washington. The data was provided by Udacity
through Motivate.

The script can be run on a Python integrated development environment. It pulls the data and asks the users a series of questions about the city, month, and day they would like to gather information. The program then presents information such as the average time of a bike ride, the most popular start and end stations, the user type of the bike program, etc...


### Files used
The files/datasets for this program are too large to upload to Github. They were csv files named after the cities involved in the datasets.

chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv
